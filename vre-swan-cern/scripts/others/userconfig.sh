# In k8s, $KRB5CCNAME_NB_TERM points to the location of the EOS kerberos ticket that notebook and terminal
# processes use. The Jupyter server uses the same ticket stored in another location ($KRB5CCNAME). With the
# code below, we force that $KRB5CCNAME becomes $KRB5CCNAME_NB_TERM only for notebook and terminal processes.
# This duality exists to prevent the user from overwriting the EOS kerberos ticket that the Jupyter server
# uses, e.g. by doing `kinit` from a notebook or a terminal.
# In puppet, $KRB5CCNAME_NB_TERM does not exist. Thus we give it a value and make $KRB5CCNAME point to that
# value.
# Both in k8s and puppet, renewals of the EOS kerberos tickets are automatically done to prevent expiration,
# both for the Jupyter server and the notebooks and terminals. However, if the user runs an explicit kinit
# and generates new kerberos credentials for notebooks and terminals, they are responsible for renewing those
# credentials from that point on.
